## Changes as compared to your installed version:

{% if (version_installed.split(".")[0] | int) < 0 %}
{% if (version_installed.split(".")[1] | int) < 6 %}

## Breaking Changes
- Unique id of entities changed. Using serial number now instead of cloud API id.
- Removed sleep switch.

## Major changes
- Added support for air conditioners (**beta**)
- Added periodic discovery of appliances.
- Added support for appliance address change.
- Enable integration configuration.
- Enable discovery of appliances at later time
- Select appliance discovery behavior via dropdown
- Add notification if appliance is discovered on the network, but was either ignored, or polled from the cloud
- Added tank removed (bucket) binary sensor
- Reverted to three presets for fan in all cases.

## Bug fixes
- If appliance doesn't load at start, integration will attempt again to set it up.
- An error during startup doesn't prevent integration to load.
- Fixed integration reload failing.
- Fixed entity naming conflicts after an appliance with same id as another old appliance is added.

_Adds support for Midea air conditioning and dehumidifier appliances via local network. Support for air condioning devices is in **beta**_

**This component will set up the following entities for dehumidifiers.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`humidifier` | Dehumidifier entity. Depending on the model following modes are supported: `Set`, `Continuos`, `Smart` (_if supported_), `Dry` (_if supported_), `Antimould` (_if supported_), `Purifier` (_if supported_).
`fan` | Fan entity for controlling dehumidifier fan. Three preset modes are available: `Low`, `Medium` and `High`.
`binary_sensor` | Problem sensor indicating when tank is full.
`binary_sensor` | Problem sensor indicating when tank is removed (_created if device announces that pump is supported_).
`binary_sensor` | Problem sensor indicating when filter needs cleaning (_created if device announces that filter is supported_).
`binary_sensor` | Cold sensor indicating defrosting is active (_disabled by default_).
`sensor` | Sensors for current relative humidity measured by dehumidifier.
`sensor` | Sensor for current temperature measured by dehumidifier.
`sensor` | Sensor for water level in the tank (_created if device announces that water level is supported_).
`sensor` | Sensor with value of error code of the appliance (_disabled by default_).
`switch` | Switch ion mode on and off (_created if device announces that (an)ion mode is supported_).
`switch` | Switch pump on and off (_created if device announces that pump is supported_).
`switch` | Switch to activate beep on action (_disabled by default_).


**This component will set up the following entities for air conditioners.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`climate` | Climate entity.
`binary_sensor` | Problem sensor indicating when tank is full.
`binary_sensor` | Problem sensor indicating when filter needs replacement (_disabled by default_).
`binary_sensor` | Cold sensor indicating defrosting is active (_disabled by default_).
`sensor` | Sensor for outside temperature measured by air conditioner.
`sensor` | Sensor with value of error code of the appliance (_disabled by default_).
`switch` | Switch purifier mode on and off (_enabled if device announces that it is supported_).
